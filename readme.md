This is a basic start for the Tour app.

There is a home page and a tour page (which is currently just a list of stops).  If you view the GitHub issues tab, you can see screenshots of the existing screens.

This can be emulated using Expo (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/).

Please note to start the process, you need to use yarn start.
